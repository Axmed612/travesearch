# Railway Deployment Setup for TraveSearch

## Current Status
Your Railway deployment is returning a 404 error, which indicates the server is running but not serving content correctly.

## Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway project dashboard:

### Database
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

### JWT & Security
```
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
```

### Optional Services (if using)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-token
```

## Deployment Commands

Railway should automatically use these commands:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start` 
- **Port**: Auto-detected from `process.env.PORT`

## Files Added for Railway

1. `railway.json` - Railway configuration
2. `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration
3. `railway-deploy.js` - Deployment script
4. Updated `server/index.ts` - Port configuration fix

## Troubleshooting the 404 Error

The 404 error occurs because:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Railway needs DATABASE_URL
2. **Build Issues**: The frontend build may not be serving correctly
3. **Route Configuration**: The Express server needs proper static file serving

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for build/runtime errors
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is set
3. **Trigger Redeploy**: Push a new commit or manually redeploy

## Database Setup

If you need a PostgreSQL database:

1. Add PostgreSQL service in Railway dashboard
2. Copy the DATABASE_URL to your environment variables
3. Run database migrations if needed

Your deployment should work correctly once the environment variables are properly configured.
